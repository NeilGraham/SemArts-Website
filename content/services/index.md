For 15 years we’ve been helping large enterprises understand what the information in their so-called information systems actually means (semantics) and how to incorporate that into their future systems (enterprise architecture).

But we’ve recently become aware that what we’ve been doing is part of a much bigger arc: it is inevitable that large enterprises will have to radically rethink the way they implement information technology. We’re not talking about some of the short term fads and capabilities, like cloud and big data that while they are important parts of the picture, are not the paradigm change we’re poised in front of.

We believe that the industry is ready to move to a data centric approach to implementing information systems. We are already at the forefront of this movement and would like to help as many firms as possible make the transition. To that end, we have repackaged our offerings to emphasize this.

##### Data-Centric Transformation

We can outline, in fairly high resolution, what the end game of the data centric transformation will look like.  This is Dave’s favorite topic.  If you’re interested in more detail, and he is awake, he will respond on whatever channel he can if you click the [ushur} button to the right, and fill in details.

You may think you are already data centric.  Many companies claim to be.  A [quick self assessment](https://semanticarts.com/assessment/) should disabuse you of this notion

So what is the data centric revolution?

The data centric revolution posits that data really is the firm’s core asset.  It needs to be expressed in an application neutral format, structure and vocabulary.  Four of the core functions that applications currently provide will be shifted to shared infrastructure:

* Data integrity and constraint management will no longer be in the exclusive domain of the application code
* Authorization rules will be expressed once and applied consistently to all access to data
* Navigation through and structure of the data will no longer be mediated by application code
* Interpretation of obscure codes and flags will be purged from the application domain and replaced by governed and well understood, and shared taxonomies

It may sound like we are promoting a product or a platform, but we are not.  We are change agents.  We are promoting a shift in thinking and implementing to this new paradigm.

This may sound like a bridge too far, but it is something that can be approached in a series of small, incremental steps, each of which is beneficial in its own right, but at the same time makes the end game more and more clear to more and more people.

#### Agile Enterprise Ontology

We were very proud of our ability to build an enterprise ontology in 4-6 months.  (Enterprise Data Models for similarly sized enterprises typically took many years and often didn’t finish at all)

We were also proud of the fact that our enterprise ontologies were often 10-100x simpler than the collective complexity of the systems they were representing.

But despite all this pride of accomplishment, we realized two things:

Even at 10-100x simpler than the systems they were covering, they were still far too complex for people to understand and implement, and
Even at 4-6 months, it was too long a delay between analysis and something useful
In parallel with this, we reflected on what we were learning by implementing enterprise ontologies in almost a dozen different industries: there are some concepts that are true in all settings, and the concepts that are different are derivative from those that are the same.

Armed with this, we have postulated, and then implemented on several projects, the idea of an “Agile Enterprise Ontology.”  The core ideas are:

* There are a small (<200) number of concepts (classes +properties which is analogous to table + attributes) that form the core of an enterprise information model
* If designed correctly, this “core” set of concepts and relationships will endure over a long period of evolution of the enterprise
* This core can be discovered and modeled in 6-8 weeks. This initial model can be comprehensive (cover most of the core activities of the firm) and structurally stable (later detail design will only have minor, localized change to the core model)
* This core can be populated directly. The idea, promulgated by most Enterprise Architecture Methodologies, that there is a difference between the conceptual, logical and physical models, is an artifact of old technology.  The core Enterprise Ontology can be populated and verified directly.  Instances so populated can continue on for a long time with minor tuning on their structure.

Further, once we have the core enterprise ontology, we can begin implementing system.  These implementations will tell us far more than additional analysis would about the quality and permanence of the enterprise ontology.  What we’ve found to date is the core withstands, with some adjustments, the onslaught of implementation.

Our interest is in helping people define the core as rapidly as possible and immediately begin putting it to use.  The use will provide further detail to a sub-ontology.  It will challenge, and may cause a refactoring of some part of the core.  The implementation will inevitably contribute to the architecture in a way that implementing another application wouldn’t.  Once you add a feature to the architecture on top of a data centric/ semantic ecology, you’ve helped more than just the immediate problem at hand.  You’ve made that capability available to a wide range of functions.  It will deliver value.

##### Everything Else

The truth is that despite, or perhaps because of, our attention to data centric and agile enterprise ontologies, we are still incredibly good at a number of things.  Incredibly good might be an understatement.  In 40 years in this industry, and 15 years specializing in what we do, I’ve yet to see anyone who is as good as we are, even in these areas that aren’t our two focuses.

I suspect our superiority in these areas is due to two things:

* By concentrating on meaning and architecture, and by working in a large number of industries we have naturally come to some general principles that are useful and true in many engagements. It scares us sometimes when we come up with things that in retrospect are obvious and beneficial, and yet we know would never have emerged from a traditional consulting engagement.
* Our culture is interestingly different. We are not selling product.  We are free to follow what we believe to be the synthesis of our collective experience and our clients’ needs.  That sounds a bit wooly and borders on marketing speak, but give me a second here: we have

That is to say sometimes we just need to keep the lights on, and if we have available time, we would be happy to dust any of our competition in the following areas:

* Feasibility Studies – we get high marks for our feasibility studies. A lot of this is because we don’t color inside the lines.  Sometimes for something to be feasible it needs to be a bit out there.  Yeah if you’re trying to figure out the feasibility of replacing your Power Builder AR system with a package, we may be your first choice.  But if you’re trying to figure out the feasibility of crowdsourcing your new product development or using sentiment analysis to refine drug / drug interactions you might want to consider us.
* Requirements Analysis – most requirements analysis projects doom the implementation to be 2-10 times more expensive than it needs to be. It’s not that requirements analysts want to waste your money, it’s just that they feel their worth it tied up with how complete and detailed their requirements check lists are.  Truth is, most of your requirements aren’t. They are just good ideas someone deep in your organization had, that somehow get vetted and surfaced and before  you know it you have a spec that will cost many times more than its worth to implement.  We’re way more interested in surfacing the core enduring requirements and solving them in a flexible way, such that the details can be handled as they justify themselves.
* SOA design/ RESTful architecture – SOA done right is a thing of beauty. It’s almost never done right. The problem with SOA isn’t the architecture.  Many firms get the architecture right.  The problem is almost no company’s bother to design the messages.  The result is the existing apps “publish” their APIs as messages to the bus, and the rest of the firm is forced to deal with the idiosyncratic design decisions of that app.  The correct approach, which we’ve done a couple of times, is to create an enterprise model of the concepts to be shared and make the SOA messages conform.  It’s not rocket science, but it’s not the norm either.
* Training – we do some incredible training including our “Designing and Building Business Ontologies” which is really a short course in getting students to think like we do (it’s not such a bad thing).
* Workshops – we have found that ½ day to 2 days workshops are a great way to break the ice with executive and other gatekeepers. We can tailor workshops to your needs, but our favorites revolve around semantics, data centric and how to apply this to your architecture.
