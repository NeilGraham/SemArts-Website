# Enterprise Architecture Design

TRS is one of the largest pension funds in the country, with 1 million active teachers and 250,000 retirees. They run the organization on a series of aging mainframe systems. In the late 90s they attempted a major upgrade to their technology but finally had to abandon that path. Since then they have mostly been front-ending their existing systems with newer proxy systems to deal with web-based clients and the like.

We worked with them to design a future enterprise architecture, featuring SOA and ontology-driven messages. They have begun work on some of the early projects in the plan.
