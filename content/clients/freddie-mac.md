# Enterprise Architecture Arbitration

Prior to the housing bubble bursting, Freddie Mac had three separate Enterprise Architecture groups. We were participating in a project that attempted (with only partial success) to find some common ground between these groups. In the course of the engagement we built one of the few artifacts that has persisted, as least as of the last time we checked in, which was a detailed "as-is" diagram of the major applications and their interrelationships.
