# Enterprise Ontology

We worked with this leading providing of legal and medical knowledge to build an **enterprise ontology for their wide-ranging content**. In addition to building an ontology for their case law and statutory product lines, we worked with their Master Data Management Initiatives. They have over 30 MDMs in various stages of development with logical data models. These models (and therefore the MDMs themselves) were integrated manually, in a somewhat ad-hoc fashion. We built tooling to convert their existing logical models into a single integrated ontology, where the integration points were far more obvious. From there we built tooling to convert the ontology back to a set of similar, but now conformed, logical data models.
