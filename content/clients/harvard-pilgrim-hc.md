# Vendor Selection for Canonical Modeling

Harvard Pilgrim is a major healthcare insurance company in New England. We had done some training and high-level design with them. When it came time to begin designing their SOA messages they asked us to help them select tools to enable this. We prepared requirements unique to their situation, scouted for and found all the products that could help with this. (At the time, Message Modeling was not a vendor product category,)

After reviewing the vendors' purported capabilities, we narrowed the field down to three and led a "bake off." We constructed a representative scenario and had each vendor model it and demonstrate the production and maintenance of messages based on it.
