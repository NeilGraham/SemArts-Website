# ERP Conversion Feasibility

(World Minerals is now Imerys Filtration)

World Minerals is the largest producer of diatomaceous earth, and a major producer of several other industrial materials. The infrastructure upon which their internally developed ERP system was based had become obsolete. (This included pretty much the whole stack: DEC VAX operating system, Alpha chips, the Rdb database, Cobol and green screens.)

They were contemplating implementing a packaged system when they contacted us. After a great deal of research we concluded:

* Because their current systems had some very complex built-in requirements that no ERP package supported, a package system would require a great deal of customization and extension.

* An automated conversion to a modern architecture would be feasible, more cost effective and less disruptive.

They opted to go the conversion route. They contracted with an implementation firm who did a partially automated conversion, but who did come in close to our estimate, and they have been using their converted systems since.
