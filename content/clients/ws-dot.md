# SOA Design and Ontology

In our initial engagement, we did a rapid but detailed review of 200 applications, interfaces, current initiatives, long-range plan, and a new system being proposed. We found several areas where they could leverage work in progress to speed up their new project initiative, and several areas where, with a slight change in scope and priority, the new initiatives would actually reduce the amount of redundancy and inconsistency. We helped them build a high fidelity depiction of their current "as-is" state. The content from an existing, unread 400-page report was rendered, and massively updated, to a very large graphic of the as-is condition. We then worked with them to define their long-term SOA architecture with shared services.
