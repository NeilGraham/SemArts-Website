# Enterprise and Ontology "Jump Start"

We have done a series of projects with Colorado Child Support Enforcement to help them understand, at a high level, how their future systems might look when they are partitioned, when they incorporate an SOA architecture and when they conform to a common semantic model.

We are currently working with COCSE  to help them create a strategic alternative to the conundrum many agencies face. They are being encouraged to implement a "transfer system" which is software that has been developed at another State's Child Support Division. While the software price tag of $0 is tempting, the implementation price tags are quite steep. Most states are spending in the $100M to $150M range to implement systems which are arguably only marginally better than the ones they are replacing.
