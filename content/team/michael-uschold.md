Michael Uschold is an internationally recognized expert with over two decades experience in developing and transitioning semantic technology from academia to industry. He received his Ph.D. in AI from Edinburgh University in 1991 and an MSc. from Rutgers University in Computer Science in 1982. He pioneered the field of ontology engineering, co-authoring the first paper and giving the first tutorial on the topic in 1995 (in London). This leveraged the work he did in creating the influential "Enterprise Ontology".

Michael is a senior ontology consultant at Semantic Arts, training and guiding clients to better understand and leverage semantic technology while he builds their commercial enterprise ontologies.
