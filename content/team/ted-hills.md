Ted is both an advanced theorist and a committed pragmatist, with grounding in ontology, data architecture and modeling, and software and systems development. His Concept and Object Modeling Notation (COMN) and related book, "NoSQL and SQL Data Modeling: Bringing Together Data, Semantics, and Sowftare", promise to change how we represent data, bridging both the prescriptive world of SQL databases and the more fluid domains of Big Data and NoSQL databases.

Ted has deep experience in financial services and financial information, having worked at Merrill Lynch, Dow Jones, Bloomberg, and as Information Architecture Executive at Bank of America. Ted also has experience in process industries, legal information, and telecommunications.
