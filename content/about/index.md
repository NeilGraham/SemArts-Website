# History

The company that is now Semantic Arts, Inc. was originally incorporated as ‘First Principles’ in Denver, Colorado in 1989.

Through the early 90s First Principles specialized in providing enterprise-level application and architectural consulting. In 1996 First Principles, which moved to Fort Collins as part of a joint venture project, was acquired by Velocity.com and operated as a wholly owned subsidiary performing the R&D function for an ASP-based software development environment.

The principals of First Principles re-incorporated in June 2000, also in Colorado, as Semantic Arts, Inc. Semantic Arts is a “S” corporation, wholly owned by the principals. It is incorporated in and registered to do business in Colorado.

Semantic Arts assists clients who have allowed their software systems to deteriorate to the point that improving business systems has become an exercise in frustration. We don’t sell hardware or software, and we don’t represent vendors. As a result, we are free to start with two inputs: your existing situation and your aspirations.


We are well-informed, completely objective, and have our clients’ needs absolutely foremost in our minds.

## Mission

Semantic Arts exists to help organizations transition to a newly emerging paradigm of information systems based on flexible data structures and deep semantics.

There is now more than enough evidence that these new approaches work, they work at scale, and they are orders of magnitude more flexible than traditional technology. Currently there is no canned package that will convert your organization to semantics, and maybe there never will be. We believe that for most organizations, the semantic journey will require discipline and conviction more than fancy software.

Most of the information systems industry is heavily invested in the status quo. But if you look very closely we think you’ll agree that there isn’t much “status” in this “quo.” In the current state of the art, application software packages take years to install, and make change more difficult rather than easier. Implementation and integration projects consume tens to hundreds of millions of dollars and fail more often than they succeed. Outsourcing, Cloud hosting and Software as a Service have made things cheaper, but not better, as they are not addressing the fundamental problems that arise from an application-centric world view.

We exist for those organizations that are ready to commit to this change. We will commit our best people and their best efforts to helping you make that transition. For over a decade we’ve applied ourselves to getting better and better at the application of this technology in preparation for the next project.

# Vision

We are a stand for the possibility that enterprises could become 100 times more agile, while spending 1/10th what they currently spend on Information Systems, by embracing the Data-Centric Movement.

Data-Centric is not a product, it is an approach. The approach is 180 degrees opposite of current "best practices" (Application-Centric) where each new business problem begets another application and therefore another silo. The end game from decades of Application-Centricity is a portfolio of applications that cost far more than they are collectively worth to keep operational and partially integrated.

This is a journey more than a destination. It requires senior level sponsorship and consistency. And some rare skills that we would be honored to supply.

## Values

Our primary focus is on making a contribution through adding value for our clients. To the extent that we create value we should be able to do so in excess of our fees, and thereby share in the value created.

Value exists in the mind of the customer. We want to be continually delivering services that the client values. We do not want to make our money via what some have called "bad revenue" (e.g., exorbitant bank fees or locked-in legacy maintenance fees), which clients yearn to escape.
